DOCKER!!!!

https://github.com/mrts/docker-python-spatialite

make a docker-image dir inside the project & enter it
clone the repo into this dir

inside the repo, Dockerfile is a template for an image which I have to build
(building command in the repo README)

Then — Usage:
Run with necessary params:
	<path to the project>:/src -p 9500:5000 -it <build name> bash

the above opens a bash shell inside the container

`cd src` and then `ls` should show the folders/files inside

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python run.py` / `python main.py`
OR:
`python run_on_zero.py` (changed localhost:5000 to be localhost:0000)

localhost:9500

MIGRATIONS:

`flask db upgrade`

(Errors)

export variables with:
`export SECRET_KEY=hgjhgkhlhlhh`
etc.
